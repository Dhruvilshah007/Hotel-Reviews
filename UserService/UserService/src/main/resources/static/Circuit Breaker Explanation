Exposed only health. So, can see health related info. ALso info about ratingHotelBreaker
and also STATE details:

Buffered calls: Success calls count
Failed calls: Failure calls(When Fallback is called, i.e any service is down)


CASE 1: CLOSED to OPEN
So, after failure Rate>=5.Circuit State  becomes OPEN,


CASE 2:  OPEN to HALF_OPEN
Now when ist is in OPEN and after 6s it will become HALF_OPEN

automaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpenEnabled: true
waitDurationInOpenState: 6s


CASE 3:  HALF_OPEN to OPEN
->So, now When in HALF_OPEN state if more than 3 failures calls are there than again it will go back to OPEN
permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState: 3




CASE 3:  HALF_OPEN to CLOSED
->So, now When service will get

#this configuration is for a service instance that uses Eureka for service registration and discovery. It prefers to use IP addresses for registration and is configured to fetch the registry information from a Eureka server running on http://localhost:8761/eureka. This is a common configuration in microservices environments where Eureka is used for service registration and discovery.
